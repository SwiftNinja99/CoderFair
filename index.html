    <p>Although people of all countries,
      eras, and stages of civilization have
      developed myths that explain the existence
      and workings of natural phenomena, recount
      the deeds of gods or heroes, or seek to justify
      social or political institutions, the myths of
      the Greeks have remained unrivaled in the
      Western world as sources of imaginative and appealing ideas.
